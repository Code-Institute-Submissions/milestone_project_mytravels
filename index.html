                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I  am a Brazilian girl who has been passionate about travels, especially about road trips. 
                    I strongly believe the world is our home and it needs to be discovered every single day.
                    I am on the road since 2013, leaving my comfort and family behind to live new experiences,
                    it took me a while to get everything sorted, 8 countries and 25 cities later I am still traveller and strong than ever.
                    Since embarking on that first world tour, I've spent the past 6 years sharing my personal journey and travel tips on 
                    this website with women around the world.  
                    I am proud to say it's our blog travel, one which everybody can collaborate so we can share our experiences. 
                    I hope this blog gives you some inspiration (and handy tips) to go and chase your own adventures. 
                    Travel is the best kind of education so go get lost, even if it’s just outside your own doorstep!<br>
                    Happy travels! I hope to meet you somewhere on this wonderful journey!</p>

        <h1 class="text-uppercase">Iceland</h1>
        <p>Iceland is the perfect destination for a seasoned traveler, a first time solo traveler, or an adventurous family looking to road trip around
        the island. 
        With friendly locals, stunning scenery, tons of adventure, and a lively tourism scene, you should experience Iceland at least once in your
        lifetime. I’ve been back twice now, and every trip brings something new.

        The highlights of my trips have been a road trip around Iceland’s Ring Road, scuba diving the Silfra Fissure, exploring the Golden Circle, 
        trying local seafood in Reykjavik, and of course, lounging in the Blue Lagoon and other hot springs around the island. There is no shortage of 
        adventure in Iceland!</p>

       <h1 class="text-uppercase">Nice</h1>
       <p>French Riviera's capital, Nice, has long been synonymous with postcard-perfect views, vibrant markets and diverse culinary scenes.
       Whether you visit Nice for it's old, intricate streets, 
       or its Parisian, wide boulevards, you are guaranteed to understand why foreign and French tourists alike opt in for a summer escapade here.
       The beauty of the French Riviera starts unravelling itself from the moment the plane prepares for landing. Beautiful mountain ranges surround 
       the colourful city of Nice which in turn appears to have an endless pebbly shore. Seeing how beautiful this 
       Mediterranean Coast really is, with its clear and teal-blue waters, I finally understood why this region is rightfully called Côte d'Azur.</p>

       <h1 class="text-uppercase">Scotland</h1>
       <p>Scotland is not just the land of Braveheart, haggis, and sheep herders. It is filled with castles, stunning lochs and mountains, beautiful parks,
       whiskey, and welcoming locals. If you spend time in the bustling cities, you can visit the University of Glasgow, admire the view of Edinburgh
       from Arthur’s Seat or walk through one of the country’s many museums. But be sure to get out of the cities into the highlands with their rich
       rugged landscapes. Head west to the islands of Islay, Jura, and Mull. Wherever you are, you’ll find yourself occupied with rich culture and history.
       Scotland is one of the most scenic and beautiful countries in the world!</p>
