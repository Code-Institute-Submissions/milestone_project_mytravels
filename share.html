                <h2>Salvador - Brazil</h2>
                <p>Salvador is a city located in the State of Bahia, in the northeastern part of Brazil, that is divided in two parts called 
                   "high city and low city", the access to these two parts can be realized by one of the tourist points of the city called Elevador 
                    Lacerda. The culture of Salvador is rich in its diversity of ethnicities, religions and natural landscapes and this was the result of a
                    historical process occurred in that city. Salvador was the first capital of Brazil, having thus great influence of the Portuguese and 
                    African culture. A tourist point that well represents this historical landmark is the Pelourinho, with old houses of the 17th and 18th 
                    centuries, museums, candomblé terreiros, cobbled streets and various churches like the Igreja de São Francisco, you can even see women 
                    dressed in Baianas and capoeira groups.

                    During the summer season, it happens in the city of Salvador, popular festivals with religious references and the carnival, 
                    the biggest popular party of Brazil. The carnival of Salvador is composed of electric trios, in which singers cheer thousands 
                    of people from all over the world in two ways: Barra - Ondina and Campo Grande. Soteropolitans and visitors can enjoy the beaches of 
                    Salvador, famous spots such as the beach of Barra and Itapuã and enjoy the bohemian district of Rio Vermelho and eat the traditional 
                    acarajé and abará. With influence of the Portuguese culture together with the African and Indigenous culture, Salvador has a exciting
                    regional gastronomy like for example: the bobó, moqueca and caruru.</p>

                <h2>Czech Republic</h2>
                <p>Nestled in the center of Europe, the Czech Republic is a country steeped in history. It’s been populated for thousands of years 
                    and is a land dotted with castles, medieval towns, beautiful mountains, ancient ruins, and world-class wineries. The country sees more
                    and more tourists each year but they mostly stick to Prague. Once you escape that beautiful (but crowded) city you’ll find an inexpensive
                    country with some of the most beautiful and rugged landscape in this part of Europe. I love taking the train from place to place and j
                    ust staring out the window. If you visit, 
                    you’ll probably be coming to Prague but be sure to leave the city and see the rest of what the country has to offer! It’s too often overlooked!</p>

                <h2>Perth - Australia</h2>
                <p>I lived in Perth, Western Australia capital. When we say Australia the first thing that come to our mind is kangaroo or 
                   koalas, but we can't find them just walking on streets, we need to go in some specific parks to see and touch or play with them.
                   There we can find a lot of other animals, not only dangerous as sharks, scorpions, spiders and others we can also find a 
                   Kookaburra, his song is very similar to a human laughing, Quokka, that is an animal that we only can find in a small island 
                   close to Perth, called, Rottnest Island or in Bald Island, load of birds free to fly for all country and several different 
                   others that only can be found in a specific area.
                   Nature is another big point there,  several beaches, one more beautiful than other, with the most memorable landscapes that 
                   I ever see in my life, in almost all beaches we find a public barbecue place, that the only recommendation is to use and 
                   leave clean for the next user and  alcoholic beverages are not allowed on public spaces.</p>
