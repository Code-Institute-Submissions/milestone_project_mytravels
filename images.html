                <h1>Salvador - Brazil</h1>
                <p>Salvador is a city located in the State of Bahia, in the northeastern part of Brazil, that is divided in two parts called 
                   "high city and low city", the access to these two parts can be realized by one of the tourist points of the city called Elevador 
                    Lacerda. The culture of Salvador is rich in its diversity of ethnicities, religions and natural landscapes and this was the result of a
                    historical process occurred in that city. Salvador was the first capital of Brazil, having thus great influence of the Portuguese and 
                    African culture. A tourist point that well represents this historical landmark is the Pelourinho, with old houses of the 17th and 18th 
                    centuries, museums, candomblé terreiros, cobbled streets and various churches like the Igreja de São Francisco, you can even see women 
                    dressed in Baianas and capoeira groups.

                    During the summer season, it happens in the city of Salvador, popular festivals with religious references and the carnival, 
                    the biggest popular party of Brazil. The carnival of Salvador is composed of electric trios, in which singers cheer thousands 
                    of people from all over the world in two ways: Barra - Ondina and Campo Grande. Soteropolitans and visitors can enjoy the beaches of 
                    Salvador, famous spots such as the beach of Barra and Itapuã and enjoy the bohemian district of Rio Vermelho and eat the traditional 
                    acarajé and abará. With influence of the Portuguese culture together with the African and Indigenous culture, Salvador has a exciting
                    regional gastronomy like for example: the bobó, moqueca and caruru.</p>

                    <h1>Czech Republic</h1>
                    <p>Nestled in the center of Europe, the Czech Republic is a country steeped in history. It’s been populated for thousands of years 
                    and is a land dotted with castles, medieval towns, beautiful mountains, ancient ruins, and world-class wineries. The country sees more
                    and more tourists each year but they mostly stick to Prague. Once you escape that beautiful (but crowded) city you’ll find an inexpensive
                    country with some of the most beautiful and rugged landscape in this part of Europe. I love taking the train from place to place and j
                    ust staring out the window. If you visit, 
                    you’ll probably be coming to Prague but be sure to leave the city and see the rest of what the country has to offer! It’s too often overlooked!</p>

                    <h1>Perth - Australia</h1>
                    <p>As a young and modern city, there are a few “attractions” here. You won’t find many historic buildings or quaint little shop-lined alleys.
                    There are no cute little neighborhoods. The city is spread out on wide streets. Yes, there’s stuff to do: The Perth Cultural Center; 
                    King’s Park; Swan River, which also provides great views of the city, or a quick train trip Fremantle. 
                    If the heat (and it gets really hot) gets to you, head to Perth’s famous beaches.
                    But it’s the people that really trap me here. It’s knowing you are miles from anything but never feeling that way. On Sundays, 
                    Cottesloe fills with young adults engaging in one of Australia’s most time-honored traditions — the Sunday Session. At night, the action heads down to Northbridge. 
                    There, the natives unwind with a good beer and socialize until the early morning hours.
                    And the locals love meeting strangers because, with the city being so far away, not many come! Normally, you go out to the bars, and people are stand-offish
                    when you try to strike up a conversation. But in Perth, everyone talks. The city is a great place to meet people — I found the locals to be very friendly.
                    Northbridge may get crowded and sometimes a little rowdy, but everyone’s always willing to talk.</p>
