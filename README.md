### Work based on other code
---
My code was first based on the previous Whiskey Drop exercise, I wanted to use Parallax Scrolling.
Lightbox gallery was used in the [Gallery](https://mytravels-milestone-luanaandrade.c9users.io/gallery.html) page.

### What changed after the user design experience (UDX) phase
---
I planned on using Parallax Scrolling effect, dividing the website by section, however I released I had too much content, and 
it would require from the user to scroll down constantly and it could result in a bad user experience. So I decided to 
divide index page into 2 sections [About](https://mytravels-milestone-luanaandrade.c9users.io/index.html) me and [Subscribe](https://mytravels-milestone-luanaandrade.c9users.io/index.html).
